# Beer Recommender

Welcome to the Beer Recommender project! This project aims to provide beer recommendations based on user preferences. It utilizes data analysis techniques to analyze beer characteristics and user reviews to suggest beers that align with the user's taste preferences.

## Project Overview

The Beer Recommender project consists of the following components:

- Data preprocessing: Clean and prepare the beer dataset for analysis.
- Exploratory data analysis: Perform exploratory analysis to gain insights into the dataset.
- Beer recommender algorithm: Develop an algorithm that recommends beers based on user preferences.
- User interface: Create a user interface where users can input their preferences and receive beer recommendations.
- Visualization: Generate visualizations to better understand the dataset and showcase the results.

## Getting Started

To get started with the Beer Recommender project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:


2. Install the required dependencies. You can use the following command:


3. Run the data preprocessing script to clean and prepare the dataset:


5. Develop the beer recommender algorithm by implementing the recommendation logic based on user preferences.

6. Create the user interface to collect user preferences and display beer recommendations.

## Must-Haves

- Beer dataset: A comprehensive dataset containing beer information, reviews, and characteristics.
- Data preprocessing: Clean and prepare the dataset for analysis.
- Exploratory data analysis: Analyze the dataset to gain insights and identify patterns.
- Beer recommender algorithm: Develop an algorithm that suggests beers based on user preferences.
- User interface: Create a user-friendly interface for users to input preferences and receive beer recommendations.

## Nice-to-Haves

- Integration with external APIs: Incorporate external APIs to enhance the beer recommender algorithm and provide additional information.
- Personalized recommendations: Implement machine learning techniques to personalize beer recommendations based on user behavior and preferences.
- User ratings and feedback: Allow users to rate recommended beers and provide feedback to improve the recommendation algorithm.
- Mobile application: Develop a mobile application for users to access the beer recommender system on their smartphones.

## Future Goals

- Expand the dataset: Continuously update and expand the beer dataset to include more beers and reviews.
- Collaborative filtering: Implement collaborative filtering techniques to leverage user preferences and similarities for better beer recommendations.
- Advanced visualization: Create more advanced visualizations to showcase the beer characteristics and user preferences.
- Deployment: Deploy the beer recommender system as a web application or API to make it accessible to a wider audience.
