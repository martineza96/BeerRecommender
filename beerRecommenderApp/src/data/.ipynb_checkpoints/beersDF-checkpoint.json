Long Trail Double Bag was originally offered only in our brewery taproom as a special treat to our visitors. With an alcohol content of 7.2%, please indulge in moderation. The Long Trail Brewing Company is proud to have Double Bag named Malt Advocate\u2019s \u201cBeer of the Year\u201d in 2001. Malt Advocate is a national magazine devoted to \u201cexpanding the boundaries of fine drinks\u201d. Their panel of judges likes to keep things simple, and therefore of thousands of eligible competitors they award only two categories: \u201cImported\u201d and \u201cDomestic\u201d. It is a great honor to receive this recognition.33 IBU\\t","2":"Notes:Long Trail Ale is a full-bodied amber ale modeled after the \u201cAlt-biers\u201d of D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany. Our top fermenting yeast and cold finishing temperature result in a complex, yet clean, full flavor. Originally introduced in November of 1989, Long Trail Ale beer quickly became, and remains, the largest selling craft-brew in Vermont. It is a multiple medal winner at the Great American Beer Festival.25 IBU\\t","3":"Notes:","4":"Notes:Called 'Dark Double Alt' on the label.Seize the season with Sleigh'r. Layers of deeply toasted malt are balanced by just enough hop bitterness to make it deceivingly drinkable. Paired with a dry finish, Sleigh\u2019r is anything but your typical winter brew.An Alt ferments with Ale yeast at colder lagering temperatures. This effect gives Alts a more refined, crisp lager-like flavor than traditional ales. The Alt has been \u201cNinkasified\u201d raising the ABV and IBUs. Sleigh'r has a deep, toasted malt flavor that finishes dry and balanced.50 IBU\\t","5":"Notes:","6":"Notes:Classified as a German Altbier by the Widmer Brothers; brewed with an (ale) Alt yeast strain.availability: early Aug. - late Oct.bitterness : 28 IBUoriginal gravity: 13.5\u00b0 PLATO\\t","7":"Notes:","8":"Notes:OMB\u2019s flagship, Copper, is an authentic D\u00fcsseldorf style \u201cAltbier\u201d or Amber Ale.

In spite of this (or just for that reason), this legendary Altbier from D\u00fcsseldorf is so full-bodied, aromatic and wholesome.Our top-fermented specialty has been brewed since 1862 from barley malt, caramel malt, roasted malt, hops, water - and with our very special Uerige yeast.Our Uerige Alt is regularly chosen among the ten best beers in Germany.

Gerst Brewery was the original Nashville brewery, but never recovered after prohibition. We are excited to partner with the Chandler Family, owners of the Gerst Haus Restaurant, to bring this beer back right where it belongs \u2013 Nashville, Tennessee.This is a very \u201cclean\u201d beer, with mostly German malts and a hint of flaked maize, remaining as true as possible to the original Gerst recipe.11 IBUs\\t","12":"Notes:This ale is the first brewed in Kansas since pioneering days. The name \"Ad Astra comes from the Kansas State Motto - Ad Astra per Aspera, Latin words meaning \"To the Stars through Difficulties\". We've blended Pale, Caramel, and Munich malts for a rich amber beer. The hops balance this malty sweetness, and we've chosen Northern brewer and Fuggles hops for their flavor.24 IBU\\t","13":"Notes:The name isn\u2019t a coincidence. This D\u00fcsseldorf style Altbier blends caramelized malted barley with pronounced hop character to create a subtle copper hue.

Mother\u2019s trio of beer connoisseurs sipped away many a night, working to find this ideal combination. Mother\u2019s beautiful brown beer is medium-bodied with caramel, toffee, and subtle chocolate malt flavors\u2014all balanced by moderate hop notes and a clean, dry finish.Three Blind Mice combines components of several malty beers for the unique brown beer experience you've been missing. After lots of research to find the perfect styles for our base, the clear winners were the lighter body and caramel characters of Irish red ales, the soft chocolate and toffee flavors from English brown ales, and the hop component and balance of German altbiers. We used traditional elements from each beer style and added our own touch for one incredible brown beer.24 IBU\\t","16":"Notes:Ishmael is our richly-flavored American copper ale. This American interpretation of the altbiers of D\u00fcsseldorf is brewed with continental Munich malt, American-grown hops, and a clean-fermenting ale yeast to produce a slightly sweet and malty beer balanced by a firm bitterness.\\t","17":"Notes:This is traditional style of altbeir from D\u00fcsseldorf, Germany. Alt literally means old in German. Staying as true to the recipe as possible, the Headwall Alt is brewed using German malts, plus German and American hops. Like the Pale Ale, the Headwall Alt is cold conditioned, dry-hopped and krausened in the bottle or keg.

This beer originated in the Westphalia region of Germany in a town named Dusseldorf. Due to the cool climate of Dusseldorf, Altbiers employee an ale yeast that has evolved over time to ferment at somewhat cooler temperature than that of other ale yeasts. This cool fermentation produces subtle yeast derived esters and leaves a clean malty beer. In addition to this cool clean fermentation, altbiers are then lagered at cold temperatures to help smooth and refine the beer. The result of this is a very clean and hoppy red ale.Coming in at 6.2% ABV and IBUs Little Red Cap is an easy drinking hop forward beer worthy of its heritage. We use a bit of Cascade hop to give it an \u201cAmerican Twist\u201d while maintaining its German heritage. This beer won a Gold Medal at the 2011 and 2016 GABF and a Bronze at the 2012 GABF.

Code named project FX, Asahi engineered a highly attenuated, highly carbonated pilsner. The later renamed product, Super Dry began sales on March 17th 1987 and gave birth to the dry beer category. The market success spawned similar competitor products and initiated what was known as the \u201cDry Wars\u201d in Japan and a brief marketing fad for dry beers internationally.

Kriek Lindemans is a good example of that. In order to obtain a beer like no other, we have been adding whole sour cherries to our lambic for generations. Our meeting with American importer Charles Finkel in the 1970s revolutionized the fruit beer segment. Charles convinced us to export our old kriek to the United States by boat. What we had not thought of is that the movement of the waves would reactivate the fermentation process and cause the corks to pop during the trip. It was like something out of The Adventures of Tintin. To prevent that from happening, we therefore developed an alternative production method for our kriek. We use fresh, not from concentrate, unsweetened cherry filtrate which we blend with lambic that is at least one year old before fermenting & macerating for up to 3 days and pasteurizing the whole batch. So the corks don't pop. Due to the use of filtrate and pasteurization, this kriek is sweeter and fruitier than Old Kriek Cuv\u00e9e Ren\u00e9, which undergoes a second fermentation process in the bottle. Thanks to its innovative flavour, it was a resounding success both here in Belgium as well as around the world. Nowadays, it is undoubtedly the reference kriek for consumers.18 IBU\\t","1601":"Notes:3 Fonteinen Oude Kriek is the result of macerating hand-picked whole sour cherries on young lambic for at least four months, in a proportion of one kilogram of fruit per litre of lambic.

These bottles are then stored in our cellars for at least five months so that the kriek lambic can develop into a beautiful, traditional, and refined Oude Kriek.

This name dates back to the Rue de Gueuze in Brussels where, for the first time, a producer offered his delicious lambic in champagne bottles. Word about the 'lambick on Rue de Gueuze' quickly got around. According to other sources, gueuze has its roots in 'gazeux' - the French word for carbonated - since traditional gueuze is a carbonated blend of different lambics.After the Second World War, some lambic brewers devised a new production method. They filtered the beer, added sugar, saturated it (with carbon dioxide) and pasteurised it. This new gueuze, closed with a bottle cap and available in 25 cl bottles, was called capped gueuze. Developed according to this production method, Gueuze Lindemans is a slightly sweeter version of Old Gueuze Cuv\u00e9e Ren\u00e9.\\t","1650":"Notes:","1651":"Notes:","1652":"Notes:","1653":"Notes:","1654":"Notes:Filtered version.\\t","1655":"Notes:Brabantiae is a gueuze that was finished in Port wine barrels.\\t","1656":"Notes:","1657":"Notes:Reuss is produced for the Bink festival.

The Iris, which is only made with malt of the pale ale type (giving a more amber colour to the beer) conserves the typical flavour of the spontaneous fermentation, the complex aromas and the vinous taste.The hopping is different too. Lambic is made with 100% dried hops, for the Iris we use 50% of dried hops and 50% of fresh hops. The latter cause a superb acidity, the former, due to their tannins, enable to conserve the beer while preserving all its qualities. After two years in the barrel, the Iris undergoes a second fresh hopping two weeks before the bottling. A linen bag, filled with hops, is soaked in the beer for two weeks. This technique, called \"cold hopping\", gives the beer a more intense savour and makes the smell and the taste more bitter.Iris is brewed only once every season and all the beers come from the same brewing. This is why the beer is dated. The second fermentation is obtained by adding liquor. Although it is a spontaneous fermentation beer, the Iris is very different from the Lambic.

The oak casks are large vats with a capacity ranging between 5000 and 25000 liters. The \"Vichtenaar\" is a traditional and typical beer for West Flanders, in the Northwest of Belgium. The taste of the \"Vichtenaar\" can be described as slightly acidic and complex and this through the long fermentation in oak casks. The fresh taste of the \"Vichtenaar\" makes it a particularly thirst-quenching beer, especially during the summer months. The \"Vichtenaar\" is also one of the last old-Flemish red-brown beers which are matured in oak casks and is especially appreciated for its authenticity by the beer connoisseur.

It is a style indicative of the irreverent creativity and unrelenting passion for beer that form the hallmarks of craft brewing in the West Coast of the United States.

This drinkability is buttressed further by a 10 percent addition of Japanese candy sugar which lends to the beer a character reminiscent of a Belgian-style Tripel.
